# Functionalities ☑️

When launching the app a splash screen appears for 2 seconds and then a new screen is shown so the user can introduce his/her nickname and choose between creating a meeting or joining one. In this screen, we have included the Speech To Text tool so it is possible to introduce the user´s nickname by speech recognition.

On the one hand, If the user selects creating a meeting there are some steps he/she has to take:
Choose the meeting location: If the user decided to create the meeting a list of theatres from the web is shown on the screen. Each place contains its corresponding  location.
Confirm the meeting location: Before starting the meeting, the user, who will become a meeting creator, faces a confirmation screen. On this screen, a map is shown with a marker in the meeting point selected previously.
Meeting screen: As a creator, this screen is launched after confirming the creation of a meeting. The screen is composed of two main elements: a map to show the meeting location and a list of messages from all the participants joining the meeting. One message contains the name of the participant and its updated distance to the meeting place each 10s. In this way, every participant knows the exact remaining distance of his/her meeting partners. In addition, there is a button that allows the user to copy the event ID into the clipboard. 

On the other hand, If the user selects joining a meeting, he/she has to introduce the event ID, which is unique. The meeting screen mentioned before will be shown and the participant list will be updated with the new participant distance and nickname. 

Throughout the application use, it is possible to activate the Text To Speech function by using the mobile proximity sensor, so when the hand is shaken near the sensor, the text that appears on the screen is read out loud, making the app accessible. Moreover, a switch button has been created on the first screen so if a user activates the TTS unconsciously there is the option to cancel it by turning the switch off.
