# 🗺️ HowFar 🗺️
### 📍 An easy way to meet 📍
Final project developed for the Mobile Devices Programming subject (Master in Science in Internet of Things)

## What problem are we trying to resolve? 🤔
Many times it is difficult to meet your friends at a point and to get everybody on time.

In this way, HowFar is a platform that facilitates event coordination by updating the distance between your friends and the meeting point in real-time. 

## Project Description 📄
The app integrates a great variety of resources such as:
+ MQTT clients 
+ Google Maps fragments
